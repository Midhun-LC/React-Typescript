This tsconfig.json file configures how TypeScript checks and understands your project. Here’s what each part does:

compilerOptions
noEmit: TypeScript will check your code for errors but won’t output any compiled JavaScript files.
target: Sets the JavaScript version to ES2022, so TypeScript uses modern JS features.
jsx: Uses the new React JSX transform, so you don’t need to import React in every file.
module: Uses ESNext modules (import/export syntax).
moduleResolution: Resolves modules like Node.js does.
strict: Turns on all strict type-checking options for better code safety.
esModuleInterop: Allows default imports from CommonJS modules (like import path from "path").
forceConsistentCasingInFileNames: Ensures file names are used with consistent casing (avoids issues on different OSes).
skipLibCheck: Skips type checking of library declaration files for faster builds.
allowSyntheticDefaultImports: Lets you use default imports even if the module doesn’t have a default export.
resolveJsonModule: Lets you import .json files as modules.
isolatedModules: Ensures each file can be transpiled independently (important for Babel and some build tools).
include
Only files in the src folder are checked by TypeScript.
exclude
Ignores the node_modules folder (dependencies).
In summary:
This config sets up TypeScript for a modern React project, using strict type checking, modern JavaScript, and compatibility with many tools and libraries.
