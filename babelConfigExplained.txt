This Babel config tells Babel to do two main things:

@babel/preset-env: Convert modern JavaScript code into a version that works in browsers that support ES modules (most modern browsers).

Tell Babel to convert your JavaScript so it works in all browsers that are used by more than 0.25% of people and are not officially outdated (“dead”).
This helps your code run on most browsers people actually use, without supporting very old or unused browsers.

"runtime": "automatic" means you don’t have to manually import React in every file that uses JSX; Babel handles it for you.
In short:
This config makes sure your modern JavaScript and React code works in all modern browsers, and you don’t need to import React everywhere you use JSX.
